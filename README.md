# Flexbox-based-Product-
This is a small Flexbox-based layout project created as part of my daily practice. On Day 3, I focused on improving my understanding of Flexbox properties such as justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap, and responsive design. This project is not a complete product, but a hands-on practice to strengthen my layout skills using CSS Flexbox
